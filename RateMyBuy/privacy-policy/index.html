      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        We appreciate your interest in our app <strong>RateMyBuy</strong>. Protecting your personal data is very important to us.
        This privacy policy provides comprehensive information about which data we collect, how we use it, whether we share it with third parties, and what rights you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        This privacy policy applies worldwide to all users and takes into account the requirements of the <strong>EU GDPR</strong>, <strong>UK GDPR</strong>, <strong>CCPA/CPRA (California, USA)</strong>,
        <strong>PIPEDA (Canada)</strong>, <strong>Privacy Act (Australia)</strong> and other international data protection laws.

      <h2>3. Data We Process</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Automatically collected data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address (shortened/anonymized)</li>
        <li>Device type, operating system, app version</li>
        <li>Time and duration of usage</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Server location:</strong> Germany (Google Firebase data center in Frankfurt). Google may access infrastructure outside the EU for maintenance purposes (e.g., USA).</p>

      <h3>3.2 Analytics data</h3>
      <p>
        We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to analyze app usage. The following data may be collected:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactions within the app</li>
        <li>Language settings, country</li>
        <li>Device technical information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data is stored in a pseudonymized form.</p>
      <p>
        When creating an account, each user can individually decide whether to allow the use of <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>.
        This consent is voluntary and can be changed or revoked at any time in the <strong>app settings</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 Advertising data (Google AdMob)</h3>
      <p>
        To finance the app, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. The following data may be processed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising IDs (Advertising ID / IDFA)</li>
        <li>IP address (anonymized)</li>
        <li>Interactions with ads</li>
        <li>Approximate location data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the first launch of the app, depending on the user's location, consent for personalized ads is collected via the 
        <strong>Google AdMob User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong>. Google decides whether this consent is required based on applicable data protection laws (e.g., in the EU or UK).
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can change their decision regarding personalized ads at any time in the <strong>app settings</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google may act as an independent controller for personalized advertising.
        For more information, see the 
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>3.4 Crash and performance data</h3>
      <p>
        Through <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> and <strong>Performance Monitoring</strong>, we collect technical data on app crashes and stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> only occurs if the user explicitly consents during registration. This decision can be changed at any time in the <strong>app settings</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>3.5 Consent history and policy versions</h3>
      <p>
        To comply with legal documentation requirements, we also store:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether and when the user agreed to or rejected the use of <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong></li>
        <li>Whether and when the user agreed to or rejected the use of <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong></li>
        <li>Date and version of accepted <strong>privacy policies</strong></li>
        <li>Date and version of accepted <strong>content policies</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information serves solely as proof that consents were properly collected and documented.
        It is not used for analytics or advertising purposes. Google, especially AdMob, may collect data for its own purposes.
        More information can be found in the 
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
